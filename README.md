## 🚀 Mission

POZITIVE AI Launchpad serves as a unified interface to navigate the rapidly expanding universe of Artificial Intelligence. It organizes the chaos into three coherent spheres:

1.  **The GoogleSphere**: The core ecosystem (Gemini 2.5, DeepMind, Vertex AI, Workspace).
2.  **Design Systems**: Next-gen generative UI, video models (Hailuo, Luma), and "The Lab" (Flux.1, ComfyUI).
3.  **Build Systems**: The agentic engineering stack (Lovable, Windsurf), grounded in "Open Source" foundations.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Research Engine
*   **Centralized Intelligence**: The Smart Search bar is now housed in the global **Mega Drawer**, accessible from anywhere via the **Menu** or **Search** buttons.
*   **Dual-Mode Search**: 
    *   **Quick Find**: Instant, regex-based filtering across all tool titles, tags, and descriptions.
    *   **AI Advisor**: A "Research" mode powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. It acts as a consultant, recommending **One-Shot**, **Bespoke**, or **Full-Stack** strategies based on your specific problem.
*   **Context Aware**: The search engine adapts its persona based on the active page (e.g., acting as a "Creative Technologist" on the Design page vs. a "DevOps Engineer" on the Build page).

### ⚡ "Zero-Latency" Interface
*   **Mega-Drawer Navigation**: A smooth, gesture-ready slide-out drawer that houses site navigation, search, and your personalized tool dock in one unified surface.
*   **Glassmorphic UI**: Built with a highly polished, dark-mode-first aesthetic using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Performance**: Optimized rendering with React 18, utilizing memoization for complex tool filtering and searching.

### 🔖 Global Collections
*   **Unified Favorites**: Save tools from *any* page (Google, Design, Build) into a single, persistent collection.
*   **Browser Persistence**: Your stack is saved locally, ensuring your toolkit is ready whenever you return.
*   **Quick Access**: Toggle the drawer to "Saved" mode to view your personal tool dock instantly.

### 🎓 Deep-Dive Learn Hub
*   **Integrated Learning**: Select tools (like Lovable, Cursor, ComfyUI, Gemini Advanced) feature a "Learn App" experience—a dedicated dashboard connecting you to:
    *   **Pro Tips & Cheatsheets**: Copy-pasteable advanced workflows.
    *   **Curated Video Tutorials**: The best content from YouTube's top AI educators.
    *   **Community Hubs**: Direct links to Discords, Subreddits, and Documentation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN/Config) + Custom Animations
*   **Icons**: Lucide React + Custom SVG Brand Assets
*   **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via `@google/genai` SDK)
*   **Build**: Vite / ES Modules

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install`.
2.  **Run locally**: `npm run dev`.
3.  **Set API Key**: Create a `.env` file with `API_KEY=your_gemini_key` to enable the AI Research features.

*Ready for Launch. Built 2025.*
